# Chapter 19: Bloodleaf Bargains
## Twin Blades, Lonely Thorn
There is something special about knowing a good thing is soon to end. Time slows if you're lucky, but all too often it slips beyond your grasp. And when that happens, you're left with the dust of memories and arms full of sadness. Sometimes, the end of something good pushes you toward better, but all too often that's not the case.

Aster wasn't pleased when we told her our plan. Travel eve-by-deim through the ninth district, then cut back eve-by-phob toward the first. Never mind that the ninth district was home to the queen's medical research. She was far more worried that we would travel to the first district at all.

Ingrid, seeing we would not be turned, simply put word out that we were leaving. The town did what anyone might have expected if she were raised a proper noble instead of suddenly appearing and as quickly disappearing. Instead of the one horse we'd brought from Powell's Square, we'd be riding from Blue Stone with three &ndash; never mind that I never quite learned the way of it before &ndash; and supplies enough to get us around the whole border of Lafleur.

Jasmin tried returning all the books to Aidan, but he would have none of it. In fact, he sent her on with several more on other topics he claimed were 'essential to the travelling lady'. Good kid, that one.

When the time arrived, I wasn't certain any time at all had passed.

"Now, since you foolish children insist on travelling directly into the darkness," Aster's tone was a mix of teasing and chiding, "you'll be needing proper equipment."

We were in her office for what was likely the final time, just before Jasmin, Vanara, and I would leave town. Apparently, she had important news for us before we set out.

Ingrid smiled at Aster's harshness. "What she means is that we've brought gifts." She poked at Aster's shoulder, prompting the severe captain of the guard to reach below her desk and produce a fine looking set of proper combat leathers. They'd been dyed a brilliant sapphire blue and bore an impression of a silverthorn flower that shone silver. "These were your mother's, or so I'm told."

Aster moved around the desk and held out the armour. "She hated this armour. Hated everything about being Lady Thornleaf. But you are going to do well out there, Roisin." 

I took the armour from her, the subtle scents of salt and copper hitting me as its weight shifted to my hands. Somehow lighter than I'd expected. I couldn't help wondering if the weight of the armour's meaning played a part in my mother's retreat.

As I worked to don the leathers, I was shocked when Aster plunged full-body into me and squeezed me in a deep hug. "Omela might not have wanted this for herself, but I know she'd be proud of you."

For several seconds, I stood, allowing Aster her moment before she finally released me and moved back behind the desk, a shimmering streak running down the side of her face.

"Now, Jasmin," Ingrid said, prompting a slight gasp from both Jasmin and me. "Oh, hush. Of course Aster told me. And after you almost said her name in front of half the town, you're lucky more people don't know." My shoulders relaxed, because I knew she was right. "Now, Jasmin. This is going to seem an odd gift, especially considering your personal skills."

Ingrid lifted a sabre from behind the desk. It looked just like the one Aster had given me along with the training blade, except that where mine was decorated with sapphires, this one was decked out in emeralds. It was clear they were a matched pair. As Jasmin grasped the hilt, I swore her amber eyes flashed emerald for just a second. She really did look just like &mdash;

"Thank you, both," Jasmin said, interrupting my thoughts. "I'll do my best to return this once we &ndash; well I don't really know what, but as soon as I can."

"No need," Ingrid held up a hand. "It belonged to the first Mrs. Thornleaf. And we couldn't keep it from its proper owner."

"Va," Aster said, barely catching the attentions of Vanara, who was poking at various plaques and decrees on the office walls. "We have something for you as well, since you'll be travelling near the Shallowroot." That captured Vanara completely, and they made complete eye contact with Aster. "An offering to leave at the temple there. Don't open it until you arrive. You'll understand."

Vanara didn't reach for the box Aster held out. Instead, they looked to me. Except, it wasn't Vanara but Vaelis whose eyes met mine. And a moment later, they were back to picking at something on the walls.

When Vanara continued ignoring Aster, Jasmin took the box and stashed it in a pack. "I'll hang onto it for safety." Both Aster and Ingrid hummed assent. "Thank you. Truly. Both of you."

Aster led us from the office and out the main city gate. We didn't stop for further goodbyes, but as we got far enough to avoid anyone seeing anyone else cry, I looked back over my shoulder at the city, at the two women who helped us. I swear, they were standing far closer to each other than strictly necessary.

Blue Stone's silver sea rose up behind us before falling below the horizon once more as we rode off to put space between us and the city we loved.
## Hundred Savings Forgotten
"So, tell me," I said as idly as we passed the final tree of the fourth district's rolling forested hills into the ninth district's wet plains, "why did we need to come this way?"

We'd been travelling almost a sevensun and making excellent time thanks to the horses &ndash; not to mention the fact that Jasmin didn't have to wait for me to rest every five minutes. Our direction told me we'd be avoiding the district's main city, but that didn't fully answer any of my other concerns.

Jasmin tapped her chin, a habit she'd leaned into heavily while we stayed in Blue Stone. "Well," she eventually sighed, "I suppose it's mostly because the gate along the mornward road into Violet's Repose is impassable. That and because coming from this direction makes us plausibly look like merchants or mercenaries."

My horse fought me as I tugged her reins in an attempt to stop. Satisfied with her slowed pace, I levelled a judgemental gaze at Jasmin, who did me the courtesy of properly stopping her own mount. "You know as well as I do, darling wife, that I can't lie to people. Look what happened in Blue Stone." 

"Then don't speak, dearest one, when we get to the first district," she said and gently squeezed her horse to continue moving. "You won't have to lie if you're a mute. Problem? Solved."

I managed to catch up with her, admitting to myself it was a good plan, except, "That won't work either."

"Why? Because you can't keep your mouth shut?" Her bright laughter made the noon sun feel ashamed. "It will be fine, Roisin. You leave me to answer the questions. All you have to do beside that is look pretty and imposing, two things you manage quite well for a woman of your stature."

"Were that not a delightful compliment, darling," I growled, "I might be offended. So long as you're not going to make me act a proper Lady."

"Now, now," she said, teasing, "I wouldn't dream of it. Especially when you would make a much more attractive Lord." When I didn't react, she added, "But I'd never ask either of you. Once a country rebel, always a bit too hard to control, given how little respect you have for the woman who saved your life."

"As I recall," Vanara chimed in, causing me to nearly fall of my horse. The horse, in turn, made a passable attempt at tossing me. "Both of you have saved each other a time or two or twenty thousand. If you were keeping score," they looked upward at nothing in particular, "I'd say Salora owes Afina a hundred savings."

"Well, no one asked for Vaelis's input," Jasmin stuck her tongue out. "Even if you are the best counsel."

"That means very little if the two of you are fighting," they said in their still odd tone. "Can't change things if you can't get along."

My breath hitched as a sudden breeze pushed its way past us, carrying with it a breath of silverthorn sweetness. Jasmin's silver hair lazily waved my direction, begging for me to explain or deflect, but at minimum to act.

Jasmin eyed me suspiciously as Vanara got distracted by some bright insect or other silliness. "You wouldn't happen to know what that was about, would you?"

The reins I held served as a decent anchor as my grip tightened at the question. "Do you want the long answer, the short answer," I said, echoing her question when I demanded truth of her, "or the honest answer?"

I watched as her face processed the words, realising I'd played her own trick back on her. She spent a few seconds in contemplation before finally asking, "Which one would scare you the most to tell me?"

"The long one," mumbling the words was all I could muster.

Jasmin's smile returned. "Then tell me the short answer. We can save the painful ones for when we have a place to rest, my love."

"Do you remember me telling you that a goddess has your eyes?" It was the best I could do.

"Yes, when we were in Thornwood Hallow. When you collapsed, and your heart stopped."

"The last time I saw her, I watched her die. She saved Afina Thornleaf. Over and over again." My breath caught as I recalled the image. "And she's lived that moment thousands of times."

She sat in silence as the words spread out around us. There wasn't much to say. Everything was laid out before us.

"I'm not her, you know." She sat taller in her saddle, her full voice behind the words, a promise as much as a denial. But that only made the resemblance ever more clear.
## Nara's Riddle, Gideon's Grave
Bogs have a miserable air about them, both in texture and smell. Still, the overpowering nature of it was somewhat of a relief after miles in a saddle. We were on the edge of Shallowroot Thicket far sooner than we'd have been on foot. It called to me just as Thornwood had. This place demanded not just our presence, but our attention.

"We're going through that," Jasmin said, her resolute grin a stark contrast from our journey into her 'desecrated grove' many moons ago. "Quickest way to the road that we'll take to the first district." The trees seemed to lean toward her as she dismounted and took her horse's reins in hand. "Besides, it's actually quite lovely here."

Following her lead, I jumped to the ground and moved to her side. "You know, I was hoping you'd feel that way."

She leaned in and kissed my cheek. "If I tried to argue, you'd probably run off into the Still Waters without me," her breath lingered on my face, "so I decided ahead of time that we'd be doing this." Waving a hand in Vanara's general direction, she continued, "And we have to go through it anyway to deliver whatever's in that box to the temple."

"Any idea about that, by the way?"

"Nara's Riddle," she said casually. "Most likely anyway. Apparently it used to be customary for travellers to leave the flower of their goddess on the steps of the temple here. For safe keeping and prosperity."

The explanation was lacking, but at least someone knew what was going on. She took my hand as my dumb expression lingered and twisted trying to sort things out.

"Va. Va Nara." Jasmin said it like I was expected to follow her path. "If you weren't so beautiful, I don't think I could put up with your slow wit."

"I'll have you know that *Salora* thinks I'm quick-witted." My hand clapped to my mouth. Jasmin stared blankly at me for several seconds.

Vanara eventually broke the silence. "Compared to Afina, certainly." They were thoughtfully considering the next words. "She once charged fully into a silverthorn patch to save a single ero fruit Salora dropped. You, at least, would look before you tripped into it."

I don't know where they got it from, but suddenly they were holding an ero fruit, which they handed Jasmin and subsequently forced her to drop directly into the bog. After several seconds staring at me, both smiled.

"See, Afina would have gone for it." Their smile broadened. "Still, though, I'm a touch surprised the tears haven't started."

Jasmin pulled me closer. "How fortunate I am to have a less foolish model."

"If we're all done impugning my honour," I drily intoned, "we really should keep moving."

There was a road through the bog. Or, something akin to a road. Or, more of a slightly higher portion of the bog's bed. I could hardly track it beyond a few steps, and it kept everyone's boots nicely moisturised, but it was better than being neck deep in the thick, murky, dankness.

Our horses were a bit less lucky, their feet sinking quickly under the path's soft surface. But they were good spirited about it.

"I noticed something, darling," I said idly as I looked about us.

"Do tell."

"Thornwood is supposed to be Salora's garden. Yet not a single silverthorn. I assume this place is one of the gardens from the poem. Yet no sign of the other four flowers."

She didn't immediately respond, instead biting her lip. "So, what happens, dearest, when a garden has no gardener?"

"Oh." We continued in silence for a long while before I spoke up again. "So who, exactly, is Gideon?"

Vaelis's voice answered. "Salora's first love. Aurelin. Though Afina's love was deeper." Her scarlet hair waved in a breeze that spread an overpowering metallic scent among us. "Aurelin died alone. No Mavi, no sisters, not even her precious axe."

Her violet eyes flooded tears as she recalled a distant memory.

"She was the last," Vaelis continued. "And after her, a queen's ransom could not stop the Fiend. This body was there, and it has held on for too long."

Neither Jasmin nor I could speak for fear of breaking whatever spell held Vaelis in that moment.

"You are right, you know," she met Jasmin's eyes, "in the box. It is bloodleaf. Brighter than the first Salora. It is no wonder your Afina is quicker as well. When we get to the temple, I shall have to leave you two behind. I can not follow into the Fiend's den."

Jasmin nodded solemnly.

"Please," Vaelis voice quaked around the words, "do not do as your precursors. Please. Fix this."
