# Chapter 4: Hewn Stones and Branches
> She had a twin and a mother, a foundation of love and care. They embraced me deeply, taking me into their fold. Misfortune, Illusion, Despair. With my fear of what would come, our menagerie incomplete. But another soon came. A sister my own. Called by the name of the arrow's tip, and charming the world with a hopeless dream: Love.
## Beloved Terror
After a few suns helping around the smithy, mostly cleaning and tidying and a bit of moving things about, I began making my way into the world outside. The bustling, hustling, constantly jarring city of a world outside. At first it was just outside, straightening the flowers they kept on the sill. Eventually, I walked the whole distance to a nearby market.

Briar, as I forced myself to think of her during my time outside the smithy, joined me some suns for company and protection. I wasn't entirely certain why I trusted that she *could* protect me, but there was a recognition of something dangerous in those eyes.

People in the city, which I learned was called Violet's Repose, all seemed to know Briar by different names. The most fascinating for some reason was Mara. Something told me it was a name she reserved for only the most trustworthy souls.

Each evening, a new geography of foods was placed before me. Kovar and Nico wanted to figure out what my deal was as soon as possible. They'd managed to gather that I must have been raised by some well-travelled folks, and I was inclined to believe them. For whatever reason, they never let me cook. It was like some game to find a way to get me away from the kitchen just long enough that food was on the table before my return.

"Flux!" Kovar would call from her anvil. "Message for the Maiden. Must be quick." And I'd run my way to the tavern and back, finding wondrous smells and lovely food on the table.

"Flux, honey," Nico would say softly, "can you run to the gate and let Steel know that Miss B has requested her presence for supper?" So I'd walk the mile to the gate, find the lithe woman known as Steel &ndash; a task that took nearly an hour itself &ndash; and return with her at my side, food ready to be eaten.

"Oh my dear Fluxy Mouse," Briar would coo just as we turned about to return to the smithy, "can't we stay out just a bit longer? I haven't stopped in to see my friend Myrtia, and it would be a delight to introduce you."

That last one was of particular interest. Myrtia, it turned out, was a noblewoman who lived within a mile of the 'forbidden courtyard' surrounding the great cathedral at the centre of the city. She was not at her home, so we instead went to a nearby library. No sign of her there either. Then a market Briar insisted Myrtia loved to frequent.

It was in the market that I learned three important things. First was that Myrtia was a title and the woman's name was Jasmin Natalia Hawthorne, a low ranking noble tasked with something called 'conscript reassignment'. Second was that she had been missing for six sevensuns, no sign of her since Briar had left town on some super secret task.

The third was what the super secret task actually was.

A wanted posting was circulating the market. A dangerous woman from a town called Powell's Square. Terrifying beast who killed at least two. And Briar would've been the third had she not escaped just in time. The woman's description was plain and unremarkable. Waifish. Brown hair, brown eyes. Presumed harmless, but a snake waiting to strike.

Reading the description over and over, I couldn't help but feel pride in the girl's achievement. In the several sevensuns since Kovar found me, I'd heard plenty about how hideous the nobles were. Briar even had a scar or two from their mistreatment of her.

It certainly helped that Briar spat at the names of the nobles. Magnia and Montgomery. The sound of them gave me a headache.

"Good riddance, if you ask me," I said as I crumpled the wanted posting and pushed cold-flame into it. Not that it would do much, but it felt cathartic to watch it light up in &mdash;

The paper as a whole ignited in my hands and went up as ash.

"Well now," Briar said with a whistle from behind her cowl, "that was something. Never seen human cold-flame do something like that. Well, save for Kovar once or twice."

"In any case," I continued as I began the path back to the smithy, "I'm glad you escaped, but I hope she gets away without issue." I was pretty sure Briar blinked a bit more than necessary as I spoke. "Am I in the wrong for being glad someone is doing *some*thing?"

"Not at all, Flux, not at all."
## Harrowing Defence
"Powell's Square, hmm?" Kovar was rolling the details around in her mouth as we ate supper. "Never would've thought Iron's little hamlet would be put at risk by a conscript who wouldn't be held."

Tenebra sat a bit too close to me as I was following her guidance around the plate, and she told me one thing after another about the food I was putting in my mouth.

"Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner, Koko," Tenebra didn't bother looking at the huge woman. "Part of the job was to get back and report and wait for the queen's decision."

"This went straight to the top?" Kovar was fighting against raising her voice. "As in, you stood in audience of the fell-queen herself?"

"For better or worse," Tenebra said idly. "Oh, that one next, Fluxy Mouse. It's called faux musk frog pudding. Don't worry. Not a frog, no musk. Only delight." As I took a bite of whatever it was, the flavour exploded. It was magical. But it didn't really spark anything. "Anyway, Koko. The queen's sent out wanted postings for this terror of a woman to every corner of Lafleur."

"Do you suppose that means it's time?" Kovar was in strategy mode. "Do we go ahead and move, or are we still waiting."

"She's the daughter of the Heroine and the Shield, Koko," Tenebra said flatly. At my confused expression, she explained. "A dreadful woman, the great-great-great&mdash;" she kept saying 'great' for a while, "granddaughter of a famous warrior from Blue Stone. You might even be descended from her too. And that dreadful woman's husband."

"Oh stop," Nico said with a growl. "Tarant was a soft and gentle sort. And Omela was purer than rainwater. You're still just hurt that they liked Ko better than they liked you."

"I am *delightful*."

"You are a brat, is all."

"Well anyway," Tenebra turned back to Kovar, "if she comes through Steel's gate, it'll all be fine. Anyone else, and we might have trouble. We need to wait though. Because what if she never shows." A thought passed over Tenebra's face for just a blink. "What if Myrtia got involved?"

"You're the only one she knows," Kovar's shoulders fell, "so she's a relative unknown. Are you sure we can trust her."

"Not what I meant. She's been missing," Tenebra pointed at a thing on the plate wordlessly and continued. "No one knows where she is. What if she went and got herself involved with *her*."

"Well," Nico was laughing about something. Probably the face I was making at whatever Tenebra had told me to eat. "Maybe they'll run away together and save us all a lot of trouble."

"But mom," Tenebra drew out the word, mocking Nico, "I'll miss my friend!"

"Oh hush you," Nico stood from the table. "You and I both know you're at least a good ten years my senior, even if you look like you could be Flux's long lost daughter." She looked between us. "Or younger sister maybe?"

Why did that hurt so much?

"Anyway, I'm sure you'll see little miss bookmouse again." Nico began rummaging around in the cabinet. "Had an idea just now. Not sure why we didn't think of it. Iron sent us some spices a few years ago."

Kovar perked up about something. "Worth a shot!"

Ten minutes later, an odd looking fish was set before me. "Riverfish with elder valley spicemint," Nico explained. "It's a bit muddy, but it tastes divine when cooked by a mistress."

Magic happened on that plate. Dramatic? Maybe. Honest? Definitely. Riverfish tasted like dirt and fat and home. Like Da in the kitchen cooking and singing with Ma rocking me in her lap as we hummed along with his raucous chorus.

"Safe, my love, here in the Stone," I whispered around the second bite. "Ma and Da used to sing to me. Not a lullaby, but a celebration song. It was family tradition on special nights. I think, maybe, Ma was with child?"

The room was silent for a moment as I continued.

"A lady in town brought us fish and spices. 'No use living were you not loving,' she said." I choked out a single laugh as a tear fell to the plate. "Ma was from Blue Stone. But Da was from somewhere else. A bear of a man. Could just about carry a house if he wanted."

That was it. Nothing else came. Just that flash. And then Tenebra's arms were around me. "Good girl. You did fine and well."
## Light, Shadow, Form
"No one is *from* Powell's Square," I heard the whispering from the second landing. Kovar, Nico, and Tenebra were on about something. This voice was Nico. "People just wind up there. How is it we got two of them shaking things up at once?"

"Can't be helped, really," Kovar's words were gentle things. "Folks been setting up there for ages. It was bound we'd find at least once or twice that they stumble away."

"I can look into it," Tenebra sounded worried, "but if it's true, we might have other troubles. Keep her busy the next few suns." I heard a long drawn sigh. "She loves horses. Perhaps the stables. Folks at the Maiden can keep a watch from there."

The door opened and closed. Then silence. I ran back to the room I'd been staying in and tried desperately to sleep. Flashes of that memory kept coming back. The woman from town was so familiar. I knew her. Obviously I knew her, since there was a memory. But there was more to it.

"Over hill and to the sea," I whispered the words from somewhere far off. Lyrics to the song my parents sang. "But here, my dove, we're safe and free. Though wind and rain and sorrow stay. The Stone will shield us all this way."

It wasn't about freedom, but safety. And it reminded me I had neither. The tears on my pillow reminded me I still didn't know how much I lost.

Morning came without fanfare. Nico walked me to the stables and set me in the care of another. I never caught her name. It didn't matter much anyway. I was still entirely lost and unable to find myself. What did I care who I was working with.

That darkness was probably why the strange person had to get my attention twice.

"Hello in there," they had a voice like smoke with a tone like loss. Not quite hollow, but familiar. They'd seen the end and stared it down. All that from their voice. "My dear friend and her wife &ndash; are we calling her your wife, love?" Someone apparently nodded. "Right. My dear friend and her wife and I have three horses we need stabled. This is a stable. You appear to be a &mdash;" They lit up when they seemed to realise I was responsive. "So you are in there, aren't you. Hello there, miss."

They had skin like damp earth after a rain. Opal eyes that glowed like life. Fiery hair tied back in an ivory ribbon. They stood about my height and wore leather armour that spoke not to money and connections, but to love. Beside them was a huge woman, standing several heads above us, who looked like she could be the smaller person's sister. Her own hair fiery was cut shorter, shaggier, in a manner that made it look like burning flames. Standing in the shadow of the huge woman was a black-haired woman with sapphire eyes and a smirk. An odd little family.

"Hello there, friends," I mumbled. "Apologies. Just lost in thought."

"It's no matter of worry. My friends call me Em, and I have some &mdash;"

"Right! Horses!" I scrambled, realising I hadn't gotten anything done. "Apologies, friends. You said there were three?" The big woman stepped forward, her shadow staying close, and pulled forward three things that I couldn't imagine calling horses, but I wasn't about to argue. "Those are &mdash;"

"Beautiful, right?" It was the bigger woman. "You would not believe how hard it was to tame them."

She was right. They were beautiful beasts. Not exactly horses, but not exactly not. They were like wisps of smoke that decided to take vaguely horse-like shapes. Their ears stood tall like a hare's. They had smooth strong muscles that reminded me of wild wolves.

"Well, I can see why. Brilliant spirits in each of them." At my words, the large woman's eyes lit up.

"You can see them, can't you!" Not a question. Not an accusation. "I've only met four or five souls who can!"

"Do you mean people can't see the large beasts before them, or &mdash;"

"What she means," the one called Em was laughing as they spoke, shaking the whole street with the sound, "is that most people just see the horses. Nyx and Tal have a habit of getting over excited. Trust, they will be by a hundred times to chat with you. Mark my words."

"Oh! Shoot!" I realised I'd missed an important detail. "Folks call me Flux. If you haven't, you should stop in at Kovar and Iron. They'll get your gear &mdash;" I noticed the three of them were carrying no packs, no weapons, no metal armour. "&mdash; well at least stop in and say hello. They're the best smithy in town."

"Thank you, Flux," Em bowed and took my hand, raising it to their lips in the same way Briar had when we met. Just the same, my heart fluttered. "We'll be in touch. Take care of these beauties."

As the big woman handed me the reins, the trio made their way up the street to the Sixth Maiden. I wanted to call after them. Beg them to take me with them. But something told me my time would come soon enough if I just waited.
## Timely Provocation
I'd been working at the stables for two sevensuns when 'soon enough' arrived a bit too soon for my liking. But I supposed it was at least 'well enough' for things to move forward. I'd not recalled anything new in the intervening time, but I'd been working out my own verses to the song about Blue Stone.

Admittedly, they weren't very good, but they brought me joy.

Briar had been gone 'looking into something' and working on side projects. Apparently the Daughters of thorn kept her busy. Kovar and Nico had been working on a contingency plan of some sort. What would they do if that woman came soon, later, ever later, or never. They had a plan for every moon in the next three years.

Preparedness taken to an extreme.

All the while, I was working the stables. Brushing horses. Humming old tunes. Chatting with the huge woman, whose name I learned was Nyx, about the odd horses she loved so dearly. Getting to know Tal, her wife. They weren't a typical couple. Never holding hands or kissing, but I could see a trust in their connection that made my heart ache, leaving my own hands feeling lonesome. My lips feeling untouched.

When the sun came that Briar was set to return, everything happened a bit too rapidly. So I will report to the best of my ability.

---
I awoke, fresh but still lost, and hummed a few bars of the song I'd remembered. Love and The Stone, Nico told me it was called. I washed and clothed myself and stepped down to the smithy where breakfast was still being eaten by the whole shop crew as the forge got back up to temperature.

There was a knock at the door about the same moment the first hammer struck. Not a soft knock of a timid person in need. Not a knowing knock of a comrade. The insistent knock of a noblewoman, enraged at being made to wait even one second longer.

Everyone moved into positions I'd seen once or twice before. All smiths at their stations, Nico at the front to welcome a guest. Me, dragged along with her as a new 'apprentice'. It was picturesque, really.

The door opened to reveal a wicked looking beast of a woman dragging Briar along by the collar. Not Tenebra. Briar.

"You're telling me, Briar," her voice was a frightful squeal, "this smith in this run-down part of the city, without a single doorman or welcome woman. This smith is the best in the capital?"

"Lady Amanita," Briar didn't quite sound deferential to the Lady's station, "I assure you that this is the place. No other."

"Why did it have to be you that survived that whole debacle with the carriage?" She scoffed and pushed Briar toward the counter. "Go ahead. Tell them why we're here."

"The fine and noble Lady Amanita of the long line of Amanita Ladies has a request on the behalf of the agricultural guild for an order of the finest quality of &mdash;"

"Will you get to it already?" She squealed and screeched every time her mouth opened. "I'm supposed to be meeting with Pec for a late breakfast, and I need you to get on with it."

"Threshing blades," Briar said softly. "A hundred or so threshing blades. And if you can, twenty new plough blades. We're looking to expand stalk farming in the deimward ninth district."

"Was that so hard, you snivelling little ungrateful &mdash;" Someone or something caught her hand as she raised it to slap Briar.

"Kind madam," I knew the voice. Nyx. Soft but forceful. "If you would, please refrain from laying hands on a servant."

Nyx stepped through the door of the smithy still in possession of Lady Amanita's wrist, closely followed by Em and then Tal. Em did their best not to look at the scene unfolding, choosing instead to stare at a bit of wood of no particular interest. Tal remained Nyx's everpresent shadow.

"I don't know how it is you folks do it in the capital," Nyx continued, "but in the Spire, when a noble raises a hand to a servant, that hand is forfeit. This kind of behaviour is why the Primroses are the only respectable nobility left."

She didn't release her grip, instead yanking at Lady Amanita and twisting her to meet her gaze.

"You will unhand me. And then you will kneel," the Lady spit in Nyx's face. I had to give her credit for brazenness. "Or else I shall be reporting you to the queen's guard."

Nyx smiled and released Amanita, who tumbled backward over her own dress and nearly hit her head on the counter. Nico tugged at my skirt and turned her head to the Lady.

"Oh, your grace," I said passionately as I knelt beside her. "Allow me to help. I cannot believe someone would do something so bold to one of your particular calibre." She waved her hands about in a manner that prevented me from assisting her.

"Get away from me!" Her shriek was piercing, shaking me and knocking me back. My own head might have hit the floor if not for Em's gentle hand catching me as I rolled over myself. "Briar! A hand!"

Briar didn't stand or move closer. Instead, Tal stepped in and lifted the vile woman wholly. "You will go now, your Ladyship," she hissed. "We'll send your servant along soon enough."

I had never seen anyone move quite so frantically as Lady Amanita in that moment. Em assisted me to a standing position then turned to Briar.

"That is why I married you," Nyx laughed as Tal moved back to her postition.

"No," Tal said as she hugged Nyx's waist. "That's why I married you. Everyone else was either taken or found that repulsive."

"Do you need a hand, *lovey-dove*?" Em's voice was different than before. Smooth, gentle, kind. They were leaning down to Briar's supplicant position. "Or are you waiting for me to join you and roll about in front of all these witnesses? Bold, don't you think? Even for you?"

"Say it," Briar's voice quaked. "Please say it, Doll."

"You act like you've not seen me in five hundred years, lovey-dove," Em was patient, unmoving from their position. "But it's good to *see* you again, Deona."

At once, everything about Briar shifted. She was on her feet holding the fiery warrior a little too tightly for polite company.

I don't know what happened or what was said. My world was spinning. Everyone seemed pleased with the moment until the thud of my head on the floor.
