# Chapter 20: A Long Walk to the Sea
> Time from my Love, Balance from the Mother, Stability from the Twin, Truth from my Sister. Stolen gifts and stolen pride. They would understand. They must, even if they could not see beyond themselves, they would know. And she would act through me.
## What Lies Beyond
We had expected to spend a moon in Greywatch Spire, but the necessity for that was spent thanks to Daya's information. And the sooner we got back on the road, the better, so we stocked up on baked goods from a highly recommended establishment &ndash; Nyx's bakery &ndash; and gathered to set out two suns after our arrival.

"So our group will travel eve-by-mar toward the Aerie," she didn't have to tell us, but Tenebra felt it necessary to offer the briefing, "make way from there to the tip of the arrow and on to the Black Lakes. After that, we'll make our way to Powell's Square.

"That's Talia, Nyxara, Micah, and myself. You four will head the other way. On to Blue Stone, through the Thicket, and eventually meeting us at the end." She gasped at the words. "Or rather, in Powell's Square. By then, Kovar should've sent word to her sister to be on the lookout for us.

"It's a longshot, I'll admit," the starlight in her eyes sparkled brightly, "but I figure the Huntress's Lady will either find herself in familiar territory or else somewhere on the arrow's path. We don't know whether we'll find her or Vanara, so be careful ladies."

"Yes, mother," Roisin drawled. No one laughed, even her. "And you four look out as well. We know how goddesses react to loss, real or perceived." She looked my way. Explicit words weren't necessary. "You'll be first in line on her vengeance list, just like in Violet's Repose."

"I could say the same thing about you, brat," Tenebra smiled broadly at Roisin's observation. "Given you and Jasmin abandoned her in Aurelin's temple."

"To be fair to my mouthy wife," Jasmin interjected, "*Vaelis* left us. Not the other way round. But both your points stand. Stay safe, grandmother. We'll do the same."

And just like that, our two groups separated. Four horses heading into the unknown past, four into an uncertain present. I watched them shrink into nothing on the horizon as we rode the other way, praying to anyone who could hear me that we would all meet again. Not in the end, but in the new beginning we were trying to create.

Lafleur is a vast place. Travel from the evemost district to the phobmost takes at least two moons by horse, even at a breakneck pace, and that's nowhere near the broadest stretch of the land. And travelling the long way between two great cities makes one think a lot on what exists beyond Lafleur.

That is a nonsense question, though. Nothing exists beyond what is. There is a great sea on the mornward side. There is a vast expanse of plains on the eveward side. The eve-by-phob direction, I'm told, is a great desert, going on forever. Deimward is a dense thicket blocking travel into 'beyond'. Phobward loom majestic mountains daring the foolish to travel them.

Asking 'what exists beyond' is a mere philosophical playground waiting to drive one mad, so imagine my discomfort at Asha asking exactly that.

"Momma," she said one morning on the road, "how big is Lafleur?"

"It's as big as it is, little one," I said emptily. "No more, no less. But the proper bounds are many miles across. So far in fact that it would take almost three years to walk the borders on foot."

"Without taking breaks?"

"Sun up to sun down, every sun for three years," I confirmed. "Big enough for everyone."

"What's out there. Past the borders?" Her eyes were tracing to our right, where we could see the mountains slowly settling into the land. In a few sevensuns, we'd see the ocean. "Are there more people?"

"If there are more people," I considered the notion, even knowing there was no answer, "I don't know how we'd find out. I've heard stories of folks out eveward &ndash; near home &ndash; who walked as far as they could, then turned around and came back. Nothing to see."

"And there's the story of Ehler," Roisin inserted, "who climbed the tallest cliff near our home and looked as far as he could. Nothing for as far as the sun shone on the land." I'd forgotten about that tale. "I set up a little home away from home at the bottom of that cliff. Right about where the rocks fell and &mdash;"

"I think Asha's a bit young to learn the full story of Ehler's Cliff, Ros," I cut her off, remembering the story of the man crushed by a boulder when he fell from the cliff. "Maybe when she's old enough to climb the cliff and see for herself."

"So we don't know?" Perceptive daughter, mine. "But people have tried to find out?"

"There are stories," Jasmin spoke up, "of a guide from long ago. She appeared as if from the mist and showed the first people of Lafleur how to manage the land. Another guide arrived and taught them to raise animals. Three more turned up and gave the people all the lessons they needed to survive.

"Each guide had a warrior with her. A sapphire-haired woman who stood proud and strong beside her Lady." Jasmin was looking at Roisin, her eyes shining their brilliant amber. "Some tales tell that the warriors came first and that the guides were created to serve them and not the other way around. The histories are unclear.

"What is certain, Ashen Huntress, is that if there's something out there," she winked at Asha, who was giggling at the new nickname, "you and Aunt Rosie would know long before your Momma or me."
## When Home Calls
The sea arrived, a silver skin on the edge of our visibility, taking up the full mornward horizon after only a few suns. It marked something of a turning point in our journey. Roisin was pushing her horse a bit harder than necessary, forcing us to keep up as she desperately drove toward the coastal city she'd come to love.

"What's the hurry, Ros?" I asked after four suns of her intense pace. "The journey won't go any faster if the horses are worked into the ground."

"Apologies, Deels, I'm just excited." She blushed. "I've missed Blue Stone, and I am desperate to see how a certain pair are doing."

"Dearest," Jasmin put a hand on Roisin's shoulder, "we'll get there when we get there. Ingrid and Aster will either be together or still coy and sheepish. The longer it takes, the better chance we have for the former."

"But don't take that as an excuse to procrastinate," I added with irritation. "I know how you are."

"No winning from any side," Roisin groaned. She turned to Asha. "What about you, little one? Do you think I should slow down?"

"Yes." Asha put both her hands on her hips to mimic an authoritative stance. "Momma's horse is getting sad. She needs more sleep."

"Okay, sweet girl," Roisin said, her shoulders slumping for just a second before that familiar mischievous gleam in her eyes returned. "Who wants to put a leash on me and slow me down?"

Jasmin's face told quite the tale, a blush spreading over her. "Dearest." One word. A command.

"Darling?" Roisin's reply was a challenge.

"Can we at least wait until we take up our room at the manor before you start causing trouble?"

"I suppose, but you'll owe me back pay, Jasmin."

"That's about enough, ladies," I was getting a bit flushed myself at their mutual suggestive commentary. "We can discuss the extent of your banter once we establish acoustics after we arrive."

---
We stopped early for the sun when the first of Blue Stone's buildings came into view. For all her urgency in arriving to the city, Roisin seemed nervous about something and spent several hours polishing her combat leathers and fiddling with her hair. Jasmin, meanwhile just stared in awe at her wife.

"I've never seen her so studious or attentive in anything," I said in a moment when Jasmin was distracted. "Is this your doing?"

"Aster, actually," Jasmin admitted with a smirk. "That woman beat your sister into shape while doing all she could to teach her to be a proper Lady." A broad laugh erupted from her. "She's your mother's cousin. The one we mentioned before. Took excellent care of us as we sorted what life was to look like for us."

"Roisin went for that?" I marvelled at my sister, who was actively cutting her hair with a dagger while using her weapon as a mirror. "I find that difficult to believe."

"It was weird, honestly. She went into Blue Stone as this quiet, brown-haired, silver-eyed ruffian," Jasmin's dreamy expression turned back to Roisin. "And she came out as a well-behaved noblewoman who could barely ride a horse." Another laugh. "As you can see, we sorted that part between Blue Stone and Violet's Repose."

"Momma," Asha was intent on Roisin. "Can I cut my hair too?"

"We can cut it for you, my Ashen Huntress," I offered compromise. "How would you like it?"

She put her hand at her shoulder. "This long." Then she grabbed her hair in two bunches. "Like this. The way Miss Scarlet Hair had hers."

My heart ached. She was becoming her own person, but also something inextricably linked to the goddesses. "Absolutely, my sweet child. We can do that for you."

"I want Aunt Rosie to do it."

"Well, I'm sure she'd be pleased to help, little one, if she ever stops staring at her own reflection."

---
The next morning, Jasmin was up first, preparing the horses and breakfast before the sun rose. It was clear Roisin did most of their cooking, but I wouldn't complain if it meant we would sleep in beds that night. When Roisin finally appeared from her rest, she looked like a warrior Lady of a great city, which I had to admit she had become.

Roisin stood tall &ndash; relatively, anyway &ndash; with her sapphire dyed leather with a silverthorn flower carved into the surface. At her hip was a terrifying sabre I'd not seen before, ornamented with a silverthorn flower on the pommel and thorned vines serving as hilt and basket. Her hair was perfectly managed, sculpted to maintain a perfect set of short curls hanging in front of her forehead. She always loved it short.

As we struck camp, Jasmin changed clothes herself, putting on a wispy gown similar to the one she wore when the Violet Cathedral fell. She looked like an ethereal spirit longing to haunt a beautiful Lady. Her silver hair hung free, forming waves on her back. What struck me most, though, was her bare feet.

The pair of them looked the part of royalty, but Jasmin had made it clear that life wasn't for them. A queen and her noble knight consort. How much the world could change in a year.

We rode to the city gate with Roisin and Jasmin at the front, side-by-side. The greeting at the gate was something else entirely.

Shouts well ahead of crossing the threshold could be heard. "Lady Thornleaf. All to arms. All to attention." Milling about ceased as Roisin and Jasmin broke the first rank and properly passed into the city. All the city guard stood at a firm attention as we passed through. On the far side of the gate were two women, clearly a couple. My breath hitched as I took them in. One of them could be my twin, albeit a few decades my senior.

"Lady Thornleaf," the one who looked like me had a gruff voice, rugged and strong. "Welcome back. When news came that the Cathedral fell, we were worried you'd not return." She turned to Jasmin. "And Mrs. Thornleaf. Or is it &mdash;"

"For the last time, Aster," Jasmin cut her off with a wave of her hand, "call me Jasmin, or else. And yes. Mrs. Thornleaf. None of the past follows me any longer."

Aster's eyes moved around the group, settling on me for several seconds before addressing Roisin again. "She lives?"

"Oh! Right!" Roisin squirmed a bit. "Aster, this is my sister Delia. She saved me. And the wee one there is Asha the Huntress."

A single brow raised at the words. "You and your mother's lot continue to confound." She turned back to me. "Delia. Madam Huntress." A deep bow. "A pleasure to make your acquaintance. My name is Rubra Aster Thornleaf. This is my belle Ingrid. Welcome to Blue Stone."
## How Life Adapts
"Tell me, Roisin," Aster was stern as we got behind the closed door of Thornleaf Manor, "why does your armour appear as though a dagger went through your heart? Related inquiry. Why are you, your sister, your wife, and your niece all glowing?"

"Something something Vaelis. Something something death. Something something death of a tyrant." Roisin's attempt at evasion caught a laugh from Ingrid, but Aster moved in and took my sister by the wrist. "Okay. Fine. I'll tell you, but can I cook lunch for everyone first? Jasmin cooked breakfast."

Both women gasped at the statement as Aster released Roisin. "You poor thing," Aster looked at Asha. "Let your aunt feed you. I can't imagine that was a happy way to start your sun, little Huntress."

"Hey!" Jasmin was smiling, despite her offence. "My cooking isn't *that* bad."

"Not to be cruel, love," Ingrid spoke for the first time since we got into town, "but even with your wife's excellent prep work, you nearly ruined smoked silver skipper. Sit down before you poison someone."

Roisin was out of her leathers in a flash, disappeared into a hallway for a few minutes, and came back out dressed like the Lord of the Manor. Without a word, she headed into a different hallway, and minutes later the smells of food were on our way to us. As she worked, Jasmin showed us around the space. Four large bedrooms, one smaller off the kitchen, a grand dining hall, two fancy bathing rooms, and a foyer clearly meant for sparring.

For the manor house of a noble family, it was rather understated.

On one wall of the foyer was a great array of portraits. The Ladies Thornleaf of the last forty generations, including Ma at the very tail end. Roisin was a near clone for them, and her portrait would be going on that wall if we made it through all of this. *When*. Not if.

"I didn't have much, given we've been gone several moons, but lunch is served in the dining hall, everyone," Roisin came out looking like she always did after cooking. Her eyes were set in a tentative pride. A subtle smirk coloured her expression. She really was at home there.

She led us all into the dining hall, where all the place settings were bunched together at one end of the table. How she managed in under an hour to prepare a feast was something I'd never figured out, but she'd been cooking since she was five. Experience is a superpower all its own.

"So tell me, dearest," Jasmin was smiling broadly at the scene, "what 'not much' means in Powell's Square. I ate more modest meals when I was still the princess."

Roisin bowed as she pulled out a chair for Jasmin. "Roasted mutton steaks, pan pastry, seared carrots, salted reposian stalks with an ero fruit sauce, and a special surprise at the end." She kissed Jasmin and took the seat next to her. "Just thought we should enjoy our first meal back home, darling."

No one spoke as we ate. Roisin's food kept mouths shut and chewing. There were plenty of *other* noises coming from around the table, and Roisin blushed at every one of them.

As I finished the last bit of the pastry on my plate, I noticed a gently sweet smell. Roisin was already gone, though I don't think anyone noticed her retreat. She returned just at that moment with a tray of hot somethings.

"Roasted fruits with a sweetened butter sauce," she announced, setting the steaming desserts in front of everyone except herself. "I kind of already ate mine." She took her seat and finally set in to talking about the grander issues. "Well, cousin, here's the short version. We confronted the queen. She stabbed me in the heart as I poisoned her with Queen's Heart flowers. Somehow I came back to life. Jasmin tore down the palace. And there are giant lizards appearing around Lafleur." She looked at Jasmin. "Did I miss anything?"

"Hold a moment. Roll that back." Aster's jaw was slack. "You died?"

"No," Asha said proudly, "she was resting. And then she woke up!"

"I see," Aster smiled at Asha, "thank you Miss Huntress. I'm glad to know it." She turned back to Roisin. "How about we stop messing about and get to the long version of events. Leave nothing out."

"One moment. Unless I'm wrong, there will be a guest at the door in about three minutes." Roisin stood and began clearing the table. "Unless you want Aidan to listen in on the conversation, we should wait until he drops off books and meets Asha."

"I don't mind the bookseller's intrusion, though the interruption will dampen the impact, so we can wait." She looked Roisin up and down. "You look the part, Lady Thornleaf. I'm proud of you."

---
A young boy, about thirteen or fourteen, arrived just as the table was fully cleared. He was dark of skin like Nyx and Em, and his manner was impeccable. In his arms were a dozen or more books, brought for Jasmin at the word she had returned. Roisin introduced him as, "Aidan, the finest bookseller in all Lafleur."

Given his collection, I was inclined to believe. Given he didn't charge Jasmin, I had my doubts.

Asha was instantly taken with him, asking him a thousand questions and occupying his attention as the rest of us spoke about what had happened. Aidan was good spirited about it, sharing a book he'd brought when he heard a child was with our group. To say he was a fine host would be a disservice to him.

When we finished telling Aster about everything, she and Ingrid stood open-mouthed and silent. I couldn't blame them. Even if they'd seen Roisin and Jasmin change during their time in Blue Stone, what we'd seen was far bigger and much more unsettling.

"So that's how the damage happened," Roisin said, disinterested. "And the glowing is because apparently I didn't just marry a goddess, but my sister is one as well. And weird things happened. Good enough?"

"It'll be good enough the moment you show me you haven't gone soft on me by d&mdash; By resting for a half-moon." Aster looked over to shoulder to make sure Asha hadn't heard the slip. She was still enthralled with Aidan and missed everything. "Put on your training leathers and get out the practice sabre. You may be nobility, but you're still my student."

"Yes, ma'am. And you can go at Delia if you like once I embarrass you."

"Try me."

Roisin's match with Aster was over in a blink. I think Jasmin may have been the only one who saw Roisin move across the room, grab Aster's wrist, and tap her forehead on the woman's chin. Aster's laughter at the scene was moderately unsettling.

"Fine. I get the point." Aster bowed graciously. "If something was fast enough to stab you at that speed, no one could've beaten it." She turned to me. "You want to have a go?"

Sparring with Aster was a treat. She was faster than Mrs. Reed, which meant she nearly kept pace with me. But what she lacked in speed, she made up for in dirty tactics and brute strength. Even so, it was like dancing. Were we unrelated, and were I a woman's woman, she might woo me with those skills.

After finding myself on my back with her blade ready to strike &ndash; three times &ndash; I called it for the sun and finally asked the question we'd all been thinking.

"So, cousin," I sighed as she pulled me to my feet, "has she come through town? Vaelis, I mean."

"Unfortunately, no. Va or Vaelis or Vanara. Not a one of the three." She ran a hand through her hair. "If she had, I'd've locked her up again. Just like when she almost killed your sister."

I shot Roisin a scowl. "You didn't tell me she tried to kill you."

"Jasmin didn't tell you how this happend?" She produced that sickly silver cold-flame in her hand. "Well, anyway, Vaelis did it to get my cold-flame out. It worked, and I survived."

"Goddesses around us, but you are frustrating."

"I love you, too, sister." She turned to Aster. "We're here for a moon, cousin. Let the town know we'll be doing just like last time. But since I won't have as many lessons, we can have them more and more often. I want no one to feel unseen or unheard."

"As you wish, Lady Thornleaf," Aster bowed lightly and took Ingrid's hand. "We'll be out now. And we'll let Aidan's family know their presence is requested for this evening's meal." She pointed over to the kids, who were asleep in a small pile in a corner. "If you need supplies, let Ingrid know. You and yours should get settled."
