This repository contains two distinct kinds of material: source code (the app/ tooling/ utilities) and expressive content/assets (the story Markdown in /content and static assets in /public). They are licensed separately below.

Code (app, components, lib, util, build tooling)
-----------------------------------------------
The code in this repository is licensed under the MIT License.

Content and Assets (/content and /public)
----------------------------------------
All narrative content and author-provided assets in /content and /public are
copyrighted by the author and are, by default, All Rights Reserved unless an
explicit license is supplied alongside the file.

- This means: do not copy, re-publish, redistribute, or reuse Markdown chapters,
  images, fonts, or other static assets from /content or /public without
  explicit permission or an explicit license statement attached to the asset.
- If a specific file in /content or /public includes a frontmatter field or a
  companion file that states a Creative Commons (or other) license, that file
  is licensed per that statement. For example:
  - content/chapter-01.md may include frontmatter: license: "CC-BY-4.0"
  - public/illustration.png may include a small sidecar file public/illustration.png.license

Third-party software and attributions
-------------------------------------
This repository may depend on third-party packages. Each dependency keeps its own license;
you must comply with those licenses when redistributing compiled or bundled artifacts.
If you redistribute the project (built or modified), include the dependency attributions
required by those licenses (see package.json and node_modules licenses). Consider adding a
NOTICE file if you bundle third-party assets that require notices.

Contact / permission
--------------------
For permission to reuse content in /content or /public (commercial or otherwise),
please open an issue or email the maintainer (ViciousElia) describing the intended use.
